\f0\fs24 \cf0 (PERSON9) Hey guys, good morning.\
(PERSON5) Yep, hi, morning, great-\
(PERSON5) ehm, so, I suggest to first go through the topics in the ehm [PROJECT2] document, <unintelligible/> document,\
and ehm then ehm do any debugging ehm which is necessary ehm to see - ehm  \
to see what is working and what is not working.\
(PERSON5) And we also have [PERSON4], ehm, yeah [PERSON4] is <unintelligible/> free, I guess.\
(PERSON5) So, ehm, the logistics, ehm is - \
ehm full Wednesday, is surely avilable.\
(PERSON5) So that's important for those who're coming here ehm from - ehm from abroad.\
(PERSON9) The presentation platform available <unintelligible/> is not yet updated\
(PERSON5) So the ehm different bridge would be - ehm would be used and the different path would be selected.\
(PERSON5) So-\
(PERSON9) Yes.\
(PERSON5) so if anyone would like to know anything about their part, ehm, feel free to add such questions in a way that is understandable to - ehm like a - late users.\
(PERSON5) Yeah, and ehm the last thing I wanted to mention is this ehm video, that we would like to record from - ehm from that, as you know the - the video form ehm the <unintelligible/> was quite successful at least for u- for ourself, I think.\
(PERSON5) ehm and, this time I have ehm a student jour- journalist, a PhD. ehm student of journalism, so he should be the more skilled.\
(PERSON5) We are still waiting for the confirmation from [ORGANIZATION3], whether they- have no objections ehm against this.\
(PERSON5) ehm and, I think that [PERSON4] will not know) today,   I think that ehm [ORGANIZATION3] finally decide ehm only on Monday.\
(PERSON5) ehm, but ehm, anyway, I told the person ehm that ehm we would like, even if [ORGANIZATION3]) does not hello him to - to go to the premises, that we would still like to do it well outside of the building, or ehm at [ORGANIZATION5], or wherever.\
(PERSON5) So, <other_yawn/> this is - this is the [ORGANIZATION4] document ehm which ehm would be then the content of the video.\
(PERSON5) ehm and ehm these- the journalist never know what to tell you, wh- what they should ask, or ehm what- what he should tell them, so actually it's up to us to - ehm to propose the propose the content.\
(PERSON5) They - ehm they will then organise it in a nice way, but we need to ehm suggest what - what should appear in the video.\
(PERSON5) So, please, if you have any ideas <parallel_talk> Sorry, </parallel_talk> just put them there. <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> </parallel_talk> , okay. \
(PERSON9) ehm, the problem is -\
ehm for the guy is to <unintelligible/> building or to recover - recall the inside it.\
(PERSON5) ehm so well ehm the- the person is avaiable and has the whole day ehm for us, ehm but ehm [ORGANIZATION3] needs to approve that he can enter the building, which is -\
ehm which they probably allow without any problems,    and that he can record and what he can record.\
(PERSON5) ehm, I think there) - is many sensible ways ehm how he can record something and still not record any of the participants, ehm and not our inper- iterpreters as well.\
(PERSON5) And we would still like to see these parts of the video, ehm but ehm in general, ehm someone needs to confirm, that - that he can be there with the equipment. \
(PERSON9) Okay, ehm please let us also know ehm if it's possible to record the) something inside the - the building, because ehm maybe ehm we - we can have) been providing recording by ourselves, at least some - ehm some scene of the situation and of the booth and <unintelligible/> and so on. <parallel_talk> Yes, exactly </parallel_talk> <unintelligible/>\
(PERSON5) Yeah yeah, so <parallel_talk> ehm <unintelligible/> video </parallel_talk> what - what I - what I ehm also have is a - is a -\
like a regular camera, big one, that ehm I use ehm at the - ehm at the <unintelligible/>, ehm so, ehm I also -\
well- t- try to - ehm get some material as a background, possible background ehm images.\
(PERSON5) ehm but ehm obviously, someone has to be fine with that.\
(PERSON5) Is -\
a - the - the room <parallel_talk> Yes, sure </parallel_talk> is not in the street regime, the - the room ehm, the lecture room, is -\
you don't need an ID card to enter this room, ehich is different from the normal premises of [ORGANIZATION3].\
(PERSON5) So, if I - when I visit [PERSON4] in his offices, I need to show my ID, they record <other_noise/> and - and so on.\
(PERSON5) ehm and - and they double-check that I don't have any knives, and ehm all the security gates.\
(PERSON5) ehm but ehm, the - ehm the - presentation or the - the workshop room is a normal one.\
(PERSON5) So it's - ehm it's easier to get ehm there and -\
but [ORGANIZATION3] has to confirm that ehm they are fine with that.\
(PERSON5) Okay, so <parallel_talk> Okay </parallel_talk> \
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/> is not working <unintelligible/>, is it? <parallel_talk> ehm </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) What is not working?\
(PERSON2) ehm I am checking my microphone, because - I don't see my name like <unintelligible/> ehm, so I thought it was broken and now it's finally working <parallel_talk> We can hear you, we can hear you </parallel_talk>, okay.\
 So, the thing is, ehm even with the interpreters, ehm there was this requirement ehm for the confidentiality or no disclosure, so I don't think it will be this easy to - get permission to record anything.\
(PERSON5) Yeah, ehm so the idea is to record ehm like the setting and what we do there, so the wires) and an empty room, or ehm interpreter's booth or maybe to watch our participants,\
the - like the biggest thing would be to watch our participants from behind <laugh/>.\
(PERSON5) ehm and ehm s-\
like-\
a-\
maybe at some point, when there is nothing ehm interesting or w- where the screen is actually not visible at all.\
(PERSON5) And- and the content of the - of what they are talking should not have be in the - in the video.\
(PERSON5) So we can make ehm, maybe ehm, like ehm <unintelligible/>\
(PERSON5) So in the worse case <parallel_talk> Yeah, <unintelligible/> regarding concerns, yeah</parallel_talk> yeah\
(PERSON2) There were even concerns from the participants that- ehm the - thing the - things there will be talk - they will be talking about - will - be - ehm well, will leak too soon.\
(PERSON5) So <parallel_talk> <cough/> </parallel_talk> there are definitely concerns, with the <unintelligible/>.\
(PERSON5) Okay.\
(PERSON5) Okay, ehm s-\
yeah, so well - I thing it's - ehm it's something that we all ehm can sign that we are not going to leak anything and that will be very ehm careful about the data and - all that, but  - obviously, yeah you- you have to decide.\
(PERSON5) <other_noise/> So - so - ehm I don't know, maybe - maybe some of the sessions should be like ehm close\
(PERSON9) for us or -\
I don't know what - what the setup would be.\
(PERSON5) <other_noise/> Yeah, on- okay.\
(PERSON5) So - ehm so [PERSON4], your - your microphone is now ehm very well ehm -\
we - we hear your typing frantically, I guess it's not - <parallel_talk> Not me, not me. </parallel_talk> not -\
okay.\
(PERSON5) So someone else <laugh/> ehm anyway, <unintelligible/> let's ehm-\
(PERSON9) <unintelligible/> \
(PERSON5) Is it [PERSON11]?\
(PERSON11) Not me. <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) No - no, I don't know, we hear someone typing ehm very loud.\
(PERSON5) <laugh/> yeah, okay, so let's get ehm the experiment running.\
(PERSON5) ehm I am talking ehm, so I'll now -\
ehm I'm talking and I'm watching ehm the subtitles.\
(PERSON5) ehm And, I'm not sure it's - if it's recognising what - ehm what I am saying.\
(PERSON5) My softer lines of English <parallel_talk> Yes. </parallel_talk> is <unintelligible/> <parallel_talk> Yes, it's - it's recognising you. </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) But what is being dispayed in the subtitles is totally wrong.\
(PERSON5) So if you look at the subtitles it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> it was microphone but - I - I touched\
(PERSON5) That's reasonable, I would say -\
(PERSON3) I - I will check what- what does it listen to <parallel_talk> Yeah. </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) Yeah, so maybe we have the problem with the input quality, which can happen ehm all the time -\
(PERSON3) No it's good.\
(PERSON5) Yeah, so that's -\
ehm my voice correctly arise, so not French, Hungary, Italian, ehm Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Spanish -\
(PERSON5) So I have the - full set of subtitles <other_noise/>, but I don't have -\
 ehm I see only some messy German ehm and some <parallel_talk> Yes </parallel_talk> completely broken ehm English, so <parallel_talk> We still have only two English segmenters so we can run at most two languages at once. </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) Oh, and we don't have anyone from ehm <unintelligible/>.\
(PERSON3) Yes. <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> some day to go </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON3) Yes tody I wrote them email to run- ten two segmenters, but they didn't replied.   <other_noise/> <cough/> \
(PERSON5) Yeah, so for now I suggest that ehm we all keep ehm connected to this call and ehm we'll do the debugging) an- at various places and <other_noise/> if you are not debugging at - anything at any point, then -\
ehm well -\
just keep working on whatever you have to do -\
ehm otherwise, but please keep listening in, ehm so that when you have problem ehm we can ask immediately.\
(PERSON5) ehm and - ehm I'll have to leave for another call in thirty minutes from now, but [PERSON3] and [PERSON20] will be ehm here ehm and-\
another thing that we ehm still have not started debugging is the - ehm is the video - broadcastings, so we should make yourself this opportunity and see -\
ehm yeah - if I can - ehm\
if I can shift the video from Linux mischief for example.\
(PERSON5) So <unintelligible/> <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) Say it again? <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> German is being- is going to be published?</parallel_talk> <other_noise/>\
(PERSON3) Yes, I - I - I - I turned English off and I started German,\
cause I struggled with - plunging English and German at once.\
(PERSON3) So I am going to r- rum them separately.\
(PERSON11) S- so can we see this <unintelligible/> somewhere? \
(PERSON6) Yes, ehm it's [PROJECT2].<unintelligible/>.com\
(PERSON11) ehm, it's not <unintelligible/> translation) service then.\
(PERSON6) It is not?\
(PERSON11) ehm Was a- was a question. <unintelligible/>\
(PERSON6) This should be using your translation service, right?\
(PERSON3) I - I am not sure.\
(PERSON11) <laugh/> I don't think it's logging anything but, <unintelligible/> is looking for the long files.\
(PERSON3) Yes, because we have English to German translator from <unintelligible/> so, I - I think -\
<parallel_talk> ehm o- okay, that's - </parallel_talk> you mustn't <unintelligible/> one.\
(PERSON11) Okay, okay.\
(PERSON3) But let's - let's try Romanian,   because there is only - your Romanian.\
(PERSON11) We have Romanian?\
(PERSON11) Oh let's see.   ehm <other_noise/> \
(PERSON3) Yes, we have.\
(PERSON3) Now I started it.\
(PERSON3) So English <parallel_talk> I - I - </parallel_talk> no - no -\
(PERSON3) [PERSON5] say something.\
(PERSON5) Okay, one, two, three, four.   ehm\
(PERSON11) Okay, I can - <parallel_talk>\
What I noticed in the English channel is that ehm I still see a lot of ehm old English subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable - </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) And I think this is -\
these words ehm were uttered by me several minutes ago.\
(PERSON6) So I think it's caching terribly. \
(PERSON5) [PERSON9], can you - can you confirm, can you somehow -\
is there a way to flush ehm the cash?   <parallel_talk> ehm </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON9) A way to flush <parallel_talk> ehm where'd the cash be? </parallel_talk>\
(PERSON5) ehm within the ehm presentation platform. \
(PERSON9) ehm in the protocol there's) the - ehm let say flush message, who actually performs the ehm flush of the <unintelligible/>.\
